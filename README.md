Running Code
If you want to run my attached code, you need to follow these steps:

Run npm install in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise.

In order to make calls to external services you need to request and add the dev.js file to the config folder.

Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:8080
